<p>Community driven Project M build with the intention to go wild and push the game even further than it already is.</p>

<p>What This Build is: Based of the dev 3.6.1 with Lyn and Knuckles included, and PMCC, this project aims to further push the limits of the game and freshen up the Project M experience over time, be it with new stages, characters, or game modes. Quality of life and high content quality are the main criterias and goals of this project. Multiple versions including or excluding some content will be offered to please everybody's demands.</p>

<p>What This Build is not: At no point in time this project aims to be either a new tournament version, or even claim to be a semi-official Project M release. Our goal is only to offer a new, fresh experience playing Project M by pushing the game's boundaries, and ideally create its own identity within the community.</p>

<a id="progress" class="anchor" href="#progress" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Progress:</h2>

<p>Basically none as of now, taking the latest version of PMCC as a base, our small group of contributors are planning the original features we want to ship with the first open version.</p>

<ul>
<li>The PMDT, for creating Project M, the original project we all love</li>
<li>The PMCC team, for proving that quality content can be made without being the PMDT</li>
</ul>
